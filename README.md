Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Airplane Crashes (1908–2023)
📊 Airplane Crashes & Fatalities (1908–2023) – EDA Project
🔍 Project Summary:
This project explores a dataset of global airplane crashes over more than a century. The goal is to analyze trends, understand fatality rates, and identify seasonal and operator-based crash patterns.

📂 Key Steps:
Data loading & cleaning

Time series trend analysis (crashes & fatalities by year)

Fatality rate calculations by decade

Deadliest crash incidents

Monthly and weekday crash trends

Operator-level insights

📈 Tools Used:
Python

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

📎 Key Insights:
Crashes peaked mid-20th century

Fatality rates have significantly declined

Most crashes happen in summer and early winter

Some operators consistently show higher crash involvement
